# Erics SQL Employee Tracker

This project, which I named Erics-SQL-Employee-Tracker, is part of the Module 12 Challenge for U.C. Berkeley Extension's Coding Boot Camp. My name is Eric Rothmuller and I am a student of the Boot Camp. In this project I was tasked with creating a prompt system that'll allow users to organize, view, and edit their employees.
